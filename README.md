## Inspiration
One of the biggest challenges in the 21st century is the widespread of misinformation online, especially because of the rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence, it is getting harder and harder for human eyes to catch the difference between [AI-generated, fake media](https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/) and real media taken or written by humans. The only way to fight against these powerful and advanced machine learning technologies is to utilize machine learning in our favor.

## What it does
The chrome extension [isAI()](https://github.com/lanpai/isAI) is a browser extension that uses machine learning to determine whether or not the media content (currently supports image and text) being viewed was generated by an AI. This user-friendly browser limits the widespread use of AI for nefarious acts not only by helping educate the average layperson about the dangers of AI misuse and its prevalence in the modern internet but also by utilizing ML models and tools created by researchers from top-tier institutes in their daily lives. The extension also keeps track of the websites and data collected by users to warn users as soon as they visit websites that are previously detected to use AI-generated information by other users.

## How We built it ##
Our team used open-source research papers/projects, [CNN-generated images are surprisingly easy to spot... for now](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.11035) and [CTRL - A Conditional Transformer Language Model for Controllable Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05858), to detect the AI-generated data. However, we improved accuracy and performance of the detection by selectively increasing the sample area cropping image on key target areas to limit model‚Äôs runtime, which resulted in incredibly higher consistency. 

We used HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, Chrome API on the front end, Python, Flask, Pytorch, Torchvision for back end ML implementation, and Node.js, Express.JS, CockroachDB for the database server.
